## Rules to follow
1. Push your code to different branch rather than master.
```git
git checkout -b <branch_name>
git push origin <branch_name>
```
2. After you made push, go to github and create pull request asking to merge your changes.
3. Don't spam with PR and explain your PRs.
4. Create Issue if any problem during contribution.
5. Respect open-source community.
